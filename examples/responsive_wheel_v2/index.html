            <h1>Winwheel.js - responsive wheel example</h1>
            <p>Here is an example of a responsive Winwheel.js which re-sizes to fit the window / device viewed on.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
                This can be achieved by setting a few parameters on the wheel. The key part of this is the scaleFactor
                is used to reduce the size of the wheel from the original values which as considered the max.
            </p>
            <br />
            <!-- Set canvas to largest desired size - i.e. the desktop size - for tablets and mobile we will make it smaller -->
            <canvas id="canvas" width="500" height="500" style="background-color: silver" data-responsiveMinWidth="200" data-responsiveMargin="30" data-responsiveScaleHeight="true">
                <p style="{color: white}" align="center">Sorry, your browser doesn't support canvas. Please try another.</p>
            </canvas>

            let margin = 30;

                // do this at time of drawing so perhaps a small change to the Winwheel.js is desired?
                // For now actually do the drawing here.

                // wheel will stay the same size inside it. We want the wheel to fill the canvas.
                //++ This assumes the wheel is to fill the canvas, if the wheel already has an outerRadius then need to scale it.
                theWheel.outerRadius = (theCanvas.width / 2) - theWheel.lineWidth - margin;

                // And we must adjust the centerX and centerY of the wheel so the center point stays in the middle of the canvas.
                //++ Again if the wheel is off center then need to scale the values rather than just setting to the center.
                theWheel.centerX = theCanvas.width / 2;
                theWheel.centerY = theCanvas.height / 2;

                // Finally adjust the font size so the text in the segments does not break out of them.
                // Find out what percent the width is of the maxWidth and use this to scale the textFontSize down.

                //++ Need some way to retain the original value and get as can't just hard code the font size.

                theWheel.textFontSize = (28 * percent);
